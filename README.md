# CSCI5552-Project-Spring2021

## About
This is the final project for CSCI5552-Sensing & Estimating at the University of Minnesota Twin-Cities
Authors: Bharath Sivaram & Isaac Kasahara

## Objective
Given a virtual environment, the robot must go from a starting location inside one corridor and
navigate to a specified goal inside the opposite corridor.

## Limitations
1. Robot can use noisy odometer, 1D LiDAR and a camera
2. Can use distinct markers (red spheres) to navigate in open area but use LIDAR to navigate corridors and avoid obstacles
3. Can use landmarksâ€™ ids to identify them, but not allowed to use their global positions

## How to run
You must have [WeBots](https://www.cyberbotics.com/) installed to run.
Go into /worlds and open 'project.wbt'. The simulation should automatically start.
The goal position can be changed by editing line 225 of the 'mycontroller.py' file, which can be found in /controllers/my_controller.
The details/explanation of the chosen path planning can be found in the 'CSCI5552_Project_Report.pdf' file.
